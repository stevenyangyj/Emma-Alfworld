Ok.

You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see nothing.
> think: First I need to find a mug. A mug is more likely to appear in countertop (1-2), diningtable (1-2), drawer (1-3), fridge (1), sinkbasin (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1). I can check one by one, starting with countertop 1.
Ok.

STATUS: FAIL
New plan: I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined stoveburner 1 instead of heating mug 1 with stoveburner 1. I should have taken mug 1 from countertop 1, then heated it with stoveburner 1, then put it in coffeemachine 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.

New plan: In this environment, my plan was to find a bowl then find and use a desklamp. However, the task says to look at bowl under the desklamp. I should have looked for the desklamp then looked for the bowl. I noticed that the desklamp was found on desk 1. In the next trial, I will go to desk 1, find the lamp, then look for the bowl under the desklamp.
